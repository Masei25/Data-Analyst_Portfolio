# Data-Analyst_Portfolio
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under on data analysis, both personal projects and some of the projects I worked on during my MSc Program

During my program, I have gained expertise in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques, as well as a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and SQL.

In addition to coursework, I had the opportunity to participate in hands-on projects and research programs where I have applied my knowledge in solving real-world problems. These experiences have provided me with strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as the ability to work independently and as part of a team.

Furthermore, my program has provided me with a deep understanding of data analysis and visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, and how to use them to gain insights from complex data sets. Overall, my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science has equipped me with a strong foundation in AI and data analysis.
